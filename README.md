## Discord

To get a token, log in to discord in the browser, open up the web inspector
(Ctrl/Cmd  + Shift + I), go to the "Application" tab and copy the value under
localStorage named "token".

The reason for using that token instead of username and password is that it is
less frowned upon by the developers. Not endorsed, per se, just less frowned upon.
